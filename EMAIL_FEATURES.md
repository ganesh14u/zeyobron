# ðŸ“§ Email Features Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the email features implemented in the Zeyobron platform using Nodemailer.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Forgot Password Functionality
- Users can request password reset via email
- Secure token generation with 1-hour expiration
- Professional HTML email template with branding
- Security measures to prevent email enumeration

### 2. Welcome Email
- Automatically sent to new users upon signup
- Professional design with branding
- Welcome message and platform introduction

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Components

#### Email Service (`backend/services/emailService.js`)
- Uses Gmail SMTP with Nodemailer
- Professional HTML email templates
- Error handling with graceful degradation
- Security best practices

#### Environment Variables
```env
EMAIL_USER=paladugusaiganesh@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=etlh jvzk tovr wdqg
```

#### API Endpoints
- `POST /api/auth/forgot-password` - Request password reset
- `POST /api/auth/reset-password/:token` - Reset password with token

### Frontend Components

#### Pages
- `ForgotPassword.jsx` - Password reset request form
- `ResetPassword.jsx` - New password form with token validation
- Updated `Login.jsx` - Link to forgot password page

#### Routes
- `/forgot-password` - Forgot password form
- `/reset-password/:token` - Reset password form

## Security Measures

### Password Reset Security
1. **Token Expiration**: Tokens expire after 1 hour
2. **Secure Token Generation**: Uses crypto library for random tokens
3. **Hashed Storage**: Tokens stored as SHA256 hashes
4. **Email Enumeration Prevention**: Same response for all cases
5. **Rate Limiting**: Backend can implement rate limiting

### Email Security
1. **App Passwords**: Uses Gmail app passwords instead of regular passwords
2. **Environment Variables**: Credentials stored securely
3. **No Client Exposure**: Email credentials never exposed to frontend

## Email Templates

### Password Reset Email
- Branded with Zeyobron logo and colors
- Clear call-to-action button
- Security warnings and expiration notices
- Mobile-responsive design

### Welcome Email
- Warm welcome message
- Platform introduction
- Link to start watching content
- Professional design

## Setup Instructions

### Gmail Configuration
1. Enable 2-factor authentication on Gmail account
2. Generate app password:
   - Go to Google Account settings
   - Security â†’ 2-Step Verification â†’ App passwords
   - Generate new app password for "Mail"
3. Use the 16-character app password in `EMAIL_PASS`

### Environment Variables
Add to `backend/.env`:
```env
EMAIL_USER=paladugusaiganesh@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=etlh jvzk tovr wdqg
```

### Render Deployment
Update environment variables in Render dashboard:
- `EMAIL_USER` = `paladugusaiganesh@gmail.com`
- `EMAIL_PASS` = `etlh jvzk tovr wdqg`

## Testing

### Local Testing
1. Ensure environment variables are set
2. Start backend server
3. Use frontend to test forgot password flow
4. Check email inbox for received emails

### Production Testing
1. Verify Render environment variables
2. Test password reset flow
3. Monitor email delivery
4. Check for errors in logs

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Invalid login" Error
- Ensure app password is used, not regular password
- Verify Gmail 2FA is enabled
- Check for typos in credentials

#### Emails Not Sending
- Verify environment variables are set
- Check Render logs for errors
- Ensure Gmail account isn't locked

#### Token Expiration
- Users must complete reset within 1 hour
- Request new reset link if expired

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. Email verification for new accounts
2. Account activity notifications
3. Newsletter subscription
4. Administrative notifications

### Improvements
1. HTML email template customization
2. Email analytics and tracking
3. Multi-language email support
4. Email queue for better performance

## API Documentation

## Dependencies

### Backend
- `nodemailer` - Email sending library
- `dotenv` - Environment variable management
- Built-in `crypto` module - Token generation

## Best Practices

### Security
- Never log email credentials
- Use app passwords, not regular passwords
- Implement rate limiting
- Hash tokens before storage
- Same response for all error cases

### Performance
- Handle email sending asynchronously
- Don't block API responses on email delivery
- Log email failures for monitoring

### User Experience
- Clear success/error messages
- Mobile-responsive email templates
- Reasonable token expiration times
- Easy-to-use interfaces

## Monitoring

### What to Monitor
- Email delivery success rate
- Token expiration rates
- User completion rates
- Error frequencies

### Where to Check
- Render application logs
- Gmail sent items (for testing)
- User feedback and support tickets

## Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- Monitor email delivery
- Update app passwords periodically
- Review security logs
- Test email functionality

### Emergency Procedures
- Disable email features if compromised
- Rotate credentials immediately
- Notify affected users
- Implement temporary workarounds

## Compliance

### GDPR Considerations
- Users can request email deletion
- Clear privacy policy in emails
- Opt-out mechanisms where applicable
- Data retention policies

### CAN-SPAM Act
- Clear sender identification
- Physical address in emails
- Unsubscribe mechanisms
- Honest subject lines

## Support

### Common Questions
- "I didn't receive the email" - Check spam folder
- "Link expired" - Request new reset link
- "Invalid token" - Ensure correct link used
