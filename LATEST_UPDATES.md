# Latest Updates - Zeyobron Platform

## ✅ Issues Fixed & Features Added

### 1. **Movie List Display Fixed** ✅

**Problem:** Movies were not showing in Admin Panel or Frontend

**Solution:**
- Modified `/backend/routes/movies.js` to allow **admins to see ALL movies**
- Regular users still see only movies from their subscribed categories
- Added authorization header to movie fetch requests
- Updated Home.jsx to include JWT token in API requests

**How It Works:**
```javascript
// Admins see all movies
if (user.role === 'admin') {
  // No filter applied
} else if (user.subscribedCategories.length > 0) {
  // Regular users see only their category movies
  filter.category = { $in: user.subscribedCategories };
}
```

### 2. **Phone Number Field Added** ✅

**Implementation:**
- Added `phone` field to User model (`/backend/models/User.js`)
- Updated signup route to accept phone number
- Updated login response to include phone number
- Added phone input field in signup form (`/frontend/src/pages/Login.jsx`)

**Files Modified:**
- `/backend/models/User.js` - Added phone field to schema
- `/backend/routes/auth.js` - Updated signup and login to handle phone
- `/frontend/src/pages/Login.jsx` - Added phone input field

### 3. **User Search Functionality** ✅

**Feature:** Search users by name, email, OR phone number

**Implementation:**
- Added search input field above user list

- Searches across: name, email, and phone number fields
- Case-insensitive search

**Location:** `/frontend/src/pages/Admin.jsx` → Users Tab

**Usage:**

### 4. **Phone Number Column in User List** ✅

  - **Green** = ✓ Active
  - **Red** = ✗ Blocked
- Separate "Manage" button for category/subscription management

const { name, email, phone, password } = req.body;
const user = await User.create({ name, email, phone, password: hashed });

// Login returns phone in user object
user: {
  // ... other fields
  phone: user.phone  // ← NEW
}
```

**3. Movies Route** (`/backend/routes/movies.js`)
```javascript
// Admins see all movies, users see filtered

  return (
    user.name?.toLowerCase().includes(query) ||
