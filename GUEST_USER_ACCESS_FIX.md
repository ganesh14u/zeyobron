# 🌐 Guest User Access - Fixed

## ✅ Issue Fixed

**Problem:** Signed-out users were seeing "No Content Available" message instead of the movie catalog.

**Solution:** Guest users (signed-out) now see ALL movies with 🔒 PREMIUM badges, encouraging them to sign up.

---

## 🎯 New Behavior

### **Signed Out Users (Guests)**
- ✅ See ALL movies on homepage
- ✅ See ALL categories
- ✅ ALL movies show **🔒 PREMIUM** badge
- ✅ Can browse the full catalog
- ❌ Cannot play videos (need to sign in)

### **Signed In Users (No Categories)**
- ❌ See NO movies (empty homepage)
- 💡 Need admin to assign categories

### **Signed In Users (With Categories)**
- ✅ See movies from their subscribed categories
- ✅ Movies they have access to: NO badge
- ✅ Movies they DON'T have access to: **🔒 PREMIUM** badge

### **Admin Users**
- ✅ See ALL movies
- ✅ NO premium badges (admin has full access)

---

## 🔧 Technical Changes

### 1. Backend Route (`backend/routes/movies.js`)

**Before:**
```javascript
// Not logged in, show no movies
return res.json([]);
```

**After:**
```javascript
// If not logged in, show all movies (no filter)
// Guest users can browse catalog
```

**Logic:**
- ✅ Guest users (no token): Show all movies
- ✅ Invalid/expired token: Show all movies
- ✅ Logged in with categories: Show only subscribed movies
- ✅ Logged in without categories: Show no movies
- ✅ Admin: Show all movies

### 2. Frontend MovieCard (`frontend/src/components/MovieCard.jsx`)

**Enhanced Lock Logic:**
```javascript
// Check if user is signed in
const isSignedIn = userCategories.length > 0 || localStorage.getItem('token');

// Check if user has access to this movie
const hasAccess = movie.category?.some(cat => userCategories.includes(cat));

// Show lock if: user is not signed in OR user doesn't have access
const isLocked = !isSignedIn || !hasAccess;
```

**Premium Badge Display:**
- Guest (not signed in): ALL movies locked 🔒
- Signed in (no access): Locked 🔒
- Signed in (has access): No badge ✓
- Admin: No badges (full access)

### 3. Frontend Home Page (`frontend/src/pages/Home.jsx`)

**Removed:**
```javascript
{/* Show message if no content */}
{movies.length === 0 && featured.length === 0 && (
  <div className="text-center py-20">
    <div className="text-6xl mb-4">🎬</div>
    <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">No Content Available</h2>
    <p className="text-gray-400">Please sign in or contact admin...</p>
  </div>
)}
```

**Result:** No more "No Content Available" message for guests!

## 🔐 Security

### Content Protection Maintained
Even though guests can SEE movies:
- ❌ Cannot play videos (protected routes)
- ❌ Cannot access video URLs (middleware)
- ❌ Cannot download content
- ✅ Need authentication to watch

### Access Control Flow
```
GET /api/movies
├─ No token → Return ALL movies
├─ Invalid token → Return ALL movies
├─ Valid token
│  ├─ Admin role → Return ALL movies
│  ├─ Has categories → Return FILTERED movies
│  └─ No categories → Return EMPTY array
```
