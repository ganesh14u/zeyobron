# 🚨 Quick Fix: Frontend Build Error on Render

## Your Error:
```
sh: 1: vite: not found
==> Build failed 😞
```

## What This Means:
Vite (the build tool) wasn't being installed because it was in `devDependencies`, and Render doesn't install dev dependencies in production builds.

---

## ✅ FIXED! Here's What Changed:

### 1. Updated `package.json`
**Moved Vite and build tools from `devDependencies` to `dependencies`**

**Before:**
```json
"dependencies": {
  "react": "^18.2.0",
  ...
},
"devDependencies": {
  "vite": "^5.4.21",
  "@vitejs/plugin-react": "^5.0.0",
  ...
}
```

**After:**
```json
"dependencies": {
  "react": "^18.2.0",
  "vite": "^5.4.21",
  "@vitejs/plugin-react": "^5.0.0",
  ...
},
"devDependencies": {}
```

### 2. Created `render.yaml`
Added proper static site configuration for Render.

---

## 🚀 What To Do Now:

### Step 1: Commit Changes (2 minutes)
```bash
cd /Users/saiganesh/Desktop/Qoder/netflix-clone/frontend

git add package.json render.yaml
git commit -m "Fix Render build: Move Vite to dependencies"
git push
```

### Step 2: Render Will Auto-Redeploy
- Render detects the push
- Rebuilds automatically
- Should succeed this time! ✅

### Step 3: If You Haven't Set Up Render Yet

#### For Static Site (Recommended):
1. Go to [Render Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com)
2. Click **"New +"** → **"Static Site"**
3. Connect your GitHub repository
4. Configure:
   - **Build Command**: `npm install && npm run build`
   - **Publish Directory**: `dist`
5. Add Environment Variable:
   - `VITE_API_URL` = `https://hansitha-web-storefront.onrender.com/api`
6. Deploy!

---

## 🎯 Why This Happened

Render's default behavior:
- ✅ Installs `dependencies` for production
- ❌ Skips `devDependencies` to save time/space

For Vite (a build tool):
- Need it to BUILD the app
- So it must be in `dependencies`, not `devDependencies`

---

## ✅ Success Looks Like:

**Build Output:**
```
==> Installing dependencies with npm...
✓ vite@5.4.21
==> Running build command 'npm run build'...
✓ built in 5.23s
==> Build succeeded! 🎉
```

**Deployed Site:**
- Status: 🟢 **Live**
- You can visit the URL
- Homepage loads correctly
- No blank page or errors

---

## 🔄 Alternative: Deploy to Netlify Instead

Netlify is actually better for React frontends:

### Quick Deploy to Netlify:
```bash
cd /Users/saiganesh/Desktop/Qoder/netflix-clone/frontend
npm run build
```

Then:
1. Go to [netlify.com](https://app.netlify.com)
2. Drag and drop the `dist` folder
3. Add environment variable: `VITE_API_URL`
4. Done! ✨

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Faster deployment
- ✅ Better CDN for static sites
- ✅ Easier configuration
- ✅ More generous free tier

---

## 📋 After Frontend Deploys:

### Update Backend CORS:
1. Copy your frontend URL (e.g., `https://zeyobron.onrender.com`)
2. Go to Render → Backend service
3. Environment → Update `CLIENT_URL`
4. Set to your frontend URL
5. Redeploy backend

### Test Everything:
- [ ] Homepage loads
- [ ] Can sign up/login
- [ ] Videos display
- [ ] Can play videos
- [ ] Admin panel works
- [ ] No CORS errors

---

## 🐛 If Build Still Fails:

### Check These:

1. **Verify package.json changes are pushed:**
   ```bash
   git log -1 --stat
   # Should show package.json modified
   ```

2. **Test build locally:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   rm -rf node_modules
   npm install
   npm run build
   # Should succeed
   ```

3. **Check Render logs:**
   - Render Dashboard → Your service → Logs
   - Look for specific error messages

4. **Try clearing Render cache:**
   - In Render: Manual Deploy → "Clear build cache & deploy"

---

## 💡 Quick Commands Summary:

```bash
# 1. Commit the fix
cd /Users/saiganesh/Desktop/Qoder/netflix-clone/frontend
git add package.json render.yaml
git commit -m "Fix: Move Vite to dependencies for Render"
git push

# 2. Test build locally (optional)
npm install
npm run build

# 3. Wait for Render auto-deploy (2-3 minutes)
```
