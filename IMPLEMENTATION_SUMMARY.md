## 🎯 How It All Works Together

### User Flow:
1. User logs in with their account
2. Admin assigns category subscriptions to the user
3. User only sees movies from their subscribed categories on homepage
4. User clicks on a movie to watch
5. System checks if movie's category matches user's subscriptions
6. If authorized → SecureVideoPlayer loads with protected playback
7. If not authorized → Lock screen shows

### Admin Flow:
1. Admin creates/edits movie
2. Selects video type: YouTube or Direct
3. Pastes YouTube private link or direct video URL
4. Assigns categories to the movie
5. Video is now accessible only to users with those category subscriptions

### Video Security:
1. YouTube private links embedded via IFrame API
2. Native YouTube controls completely disabled
3. Custom overlay controls provided
4. All download/inspect methods blocked
5. URLs hidden from network inspection
